# Titanic-ML-From-Disaster âš“ðŸš¢

## Overview
Welcome to our GitHub repository for the Kaggle Titanic Machine Learning competition! In this competition, the goal is to use machine learning techniques to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. This legendary challenge is an excellent opportunity to dive into the world of machine learning competitions and familiarize yourself with the Kaggle platform.

## Challenge Description
The sinking of the Titanic on April 15, 1912, is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. Despite being considered "unsinkable," the RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, leading to the tragic loss of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew due to insufficient lifeboats.

The challenge is to build a predictive model that answers the question: "What sorts of people were more likely to survive?" using passenger data such as name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. While there is an element of luck in surviving, the goal is to identify patterns that suggest certain groups of people had a higher likelihood of survival.

## Dataset
- **Train.csv**: Contains details of a subset of passengers (891) with information on whether they survived or not (ground truth).
- **Test.csv**: Similar information for 418 passengers without disclosing the ground truth. Your task is to predict their outcomes.

## Repository Contents
- **Code**: Jupyter Notebooks used for data exploration, preprocessing, and model building.
- **Data**: Folder containing the competition datasets (`train.csv` and `test.csv`).
- **Submission Files**: Files containing predictions for the test set.
